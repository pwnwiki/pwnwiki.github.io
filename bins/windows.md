| usbdump.exe | Once executed, usbdump will run in the background and will dump the contents of all connected usb devices to a randomly numbered folder within the same directory as the usbdump.exe program. Useful for grabbing the contents of any usb devices later connected to a compromized machine. May have to modify it to bypass AV as its signature is in quite a few AV's. | Ian |
