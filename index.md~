### PwnWiki.io is a collection TTPs (tools, tactics, and procedures) for what to do after access has been gained.

### Live Online Copy:

You can find a copy of the project online at: http://pwnwiki.io

### Offline Use:

  1. Clone the repository or pull the archive ([download zip](https://github.com/pwnwiki/pwnwiki.github.io/archive/master.zip)) of the repo
  2. Open index.html
  3. Most modern browsers don't allow the access of local files from a locally loaded HTML file. On Windows you can use [Mongoose Tiny](http://cesanta.com/downloads.html) or [HFS](http://www.rejetto.com/hfs/) to host the files locally. On OSX and Linux `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` seems to work just fine.

#### Referenced tools can be found here: https://github.com/mubix/post-exploitation (If they aren't built into the OS)

#### Submitting Content
We want/need your help! Please contribute to this project is via GitHub (https://github.com/pwnwiki/pwnwiki.github.io). That allows us to get your project-ready content incorporated into the wiki fast. 

We realize that not everyone can/wants to submit content via GitHub and that's cool. If your go-to content is not up here and you don't want to spend the time becoming a Git Jedi, just visit our [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1N7-jRjnUXoz-UwB2h0du2IrskFJW6hBGs4YsTwvEncE/viewform). Due to the large amount of submissions and content, there may be a delay between your posting and us getting your content into the project. Thanks for your submissions and your patience!
