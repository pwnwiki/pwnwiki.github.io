Metasploit Usage Wiki
=======

The purpose of this wiki is to document usage and examples that usually disappears into merged pull requests. The wiki will follow the module directory and file structure (instead of a .rb there will be an .md). 

This wiki will grow into a place where people can reference for best usages and learn about other modules.
